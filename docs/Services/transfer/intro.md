# Technology Transfer

What do we mean, when we say "Technology Transfer," and why do we think it is important?

## What is Technology Transfer?

Technology Transfer is the process of transferring knowledge from one organization to another.  In our case, we are talking about transferring knowledge primarily from the open source community, to the commercial community. As our businesses progress and we seek software solutions to our problems, we often find that the open source community has already solved many of our problems.  However, the open source community is not always the best at communicating their solutions to the commercial community.  This is where we come in.  We have a deep understanding of the open source community, and we can help you understand how to leverage the open source community to solve your problems.

This path is free of vendor lock-in and gives your organization an opportunity to develop lasting in-house expertise that will pay dividends, rather than bills with ever-increasing vendor fees which rise in perfect correlation with your organization's success.

## Why is Technology Transfer Important?

The alternative to vendors and technology transfer is building expertise up in-house. This is a viable path for those who have more time than money, and a path we encourage for many organizations.  However, it is not always the best path.  Sometimes, you need to get a product to market quickly, and you don't have time to build up the expertise in-house.  In these cases, often the most cost effective and time effective solution is to wire up an off-the-shelf open source solution.  This is where we come in.  We can help you understand the open source landscape, and help you find the right solution for your needs.  We can build the initial solution for you, and then help you understand how to maintain it in-house.  We can also help you understand how to build up the expertise in-house, so that you can maintain the solution as a normal part of doing business, and eventually, you can even improve upon the solution.
